// quick sort
// chooses a parition point usually the last element
// then runs a comparison with all the other elements 
// if the element is less than the parition point, it stays on the left side (of the parition point)
// if the element is greater than the parition point, it get moved to the right side of the parition point.
// time complexity
// space complexity
